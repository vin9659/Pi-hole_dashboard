# 520_project

Our project aims at demonstrating how we can use a Pihole as a service to block ads and trackers thereby protecting end users privacy. 
This FastAPI serves as a backend for the frontend dashboard through which a user can control the Pihole and see stats related to how effective the Pihole is.
